At the time of creating this SPA I was learning AngularJS. I was looking for some sort of news app that I could practice parsing JSON and dispaying it correct through AngularJS. NYT api documentation made it really easy to go through that process.

#What I Learned
Well, I learned a whole lot of AngularJS, using, routes, controllers, injecting dependencies, etc. Being able to call on an API and parse the JSON, I was able to make a new object from the returned data using Angular's forEach function. 

#Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* AngularJS
* SASS/SCSS
* BootSTrap

#Problems?
One of he main problems that I couldn't find a good answer to is that, some of the articles don't have an image on them. So, the result card comes up kind of blank. I wanted to replace that with just a generic NYT logo if the image was not there when I called the API but I haven't figured out how to do that the Angular way.
